# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 1 : July 09 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : 

* Started by watching Siraj Raval's youtube tutorial [Learn Python for Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2-dafEMk2A6QKz1mrk1uIGfHkC1zZ6UU). I've got the link to his tutorial from his repo [Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months](https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months) at the <b>Month 2 - Week 1</b> section.
* Created a new repo on github to test out the use of [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) and [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) for sentiment analysis.

**Thoughts** : I passed a lot of time debugging errors like char encoding, file open mode (i was writing str and i opened the file with the binary option), tweepy rate limit exceeded and such. But I had fun working on this.

**What I learned**:

* How to create + fill a csv file
* How to use tweepy (twitter python API)
* How to do a sentiment analysis using a bag of words based algorithm (Naive Bayes implemented in the TextBlob library)
* How to use re library (for regex on strings)

**Link of Work:**   [sentiment-analysis-twitter-textblob](https://github.com/touir1/sentiment-analysis-twitter-textblob) Github Repository.
