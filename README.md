# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

This challenge was proposed By [Siraj Raval](https://twitter.com/sirajraval).

## Day 1 : July 09 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : 

* Started by watching Siraj Raval's youtube tutorial [Learn Python for Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2-dafEMk2A6QKz1mrk1uIGfHkC1zZ6UU). I've got the link to his tutorial from his repo [Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months](https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months) at the <b>Month 2 - Week 1</b> section.
* Created a new repo on github to test out the use of [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) and [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) for sentiment analysis.

**Thoughts** : I passed a lot of time debugging errors like char encoding, file open mode (i was writing str and i opened the file with the binary option), tweepy rate limit exceeded and such. But I had fun working on this.

**What I learned**:

* How to create + fill a csv file.
* How to use tweepy (twitter python API).
* How to do a sentiment analysis using a bag of words based algorithm (Naive Bayes implemented in the TextBlob library).
* How to use re library (for regex on strings).

**Link of Work:**   [sentiment-analysis-twitter-textblob](https://github.com/touir1/sentiment-analysis-twitter-textblob) Github Repository.

## Day 2 : July 10 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : 

* Started watching a video by Siraj Raval on Recommendation Systems.
* Dropped watching that video and started a machine learning course from scratch by [Google](https://www.google.com) ([Introduction to machine learning](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/)). I stopped after finishing the <b>Descending into ML</b> section. 

**Thoughts** : It wasn't as easy as yesterday to understand the content of a video on machine learning. It had a lot of terms that I don't know so I prefered to start from scratch learning ML.

**What I learned**:

* Some basic [ML terminologies](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/framing/ml-terminology).
* Basic [Linear Regression](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/descending-into-ml/linear-regression).
* A loss functions named [Mean squared error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error).
* How to use the [markdown](https://medium.com/ibm-data-science-experience/markdown-for-jupyter-notebooks-cheatsheet-386c05aeebed) in the jupyter notebook.

**Link of Work:**   I passed the time reading so no work examples for today.

**TODO Next:**
- [ ] Test out the linear regression algorithm with python(coded from scratch and using some ML libraries).
- [ ] Try to represent data into graphs with python.
- [ ] Learn how to animate the learning process of ML algorithms.

## Day 3 : July 11 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : 

* Watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY9Bc3mtphs) by Siraj Raval on the application of the Generative Adversarial Networks ([GAN](https://hackernoon.com/generative-adversarial-networks-a-deep-learning-architecture-4253b6d12347) for short) to discover new drugs.
* Studied some basics of machine learning like [Partial derivative](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/partial-derivatives/v/partial-derivatives-introduction), [Gradient Descent](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/reducing-loss/gradient-descent) and [Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/reducing-loss/stochastic-gradient-descent).

**Thoughts** : I think that i'm going to choose a project where i'm going to applyML in the medical field. I like that idea. I found myself lacking the basics of calculus so I started watching videos + some tutorials to fill the gap.

**What I learned**:

* Some new terms like GAN and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
* How does the partial derivative work.
* How does the gradient descent work.

**TODO Next:**
- [ ] To complete
